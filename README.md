# Credit-Card-Churn-Prediction
Aim is to analyse the data, clean the noisy data and use multiple machine learning algorithms like logistic regression, Decision Tree, Random forest, and PCA algorithm to create optimal model to predict a customers whom are likely to stop credit-card service.



# Problem statement:  
Customer churn is a business term expression which describes loss of customers.
Firms invest in order not to lose their customers. Marketing departments continu-
ously investigate the behavior of their existing customers and potential customers
to understand the underlying causes of churn.



# Conclusion:
Using pruning in a decision tree yields not only enhanced efficiency but also reduced bias and variance. Therefore, we have chosen to employ a decision tree classifier with pruning for our final model training.
